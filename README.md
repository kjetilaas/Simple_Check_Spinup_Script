Simple script to check FATES spinup

This is a light-weight script to check output from FATES spinup. It currently only works with FATES output, and only for SE grid (not lat/lon). Currently, it also calculates VEGC from TOTECOSYSC - TOTSOMC if it is not available in output (which is not the same). I.e., use with caution!
